## Project Description

This project presents an interactive, scroll-driven narrative visualization that explores the unique characteristics of anti-Asian hate crimes in the United States and compares them to those targeting other racial and ethnic groups, such as African Americans and Hispanics. By allowing users to engage with multiple dimensions of the data‚Äîsuch as victim-offender relationships, crime locations, and offender demographics‚Äîthe visualization seeks to illuminate how anti-Asian hate crimes manifest differently and may require group-specific responses.

Users can follow a narrative walkthrough of key findings, explore state-level trends through dynamic maps, and compare bias types in terms of their social context and frequency.

## Key Insights

- **Public Spaces & Strangers**: Anti-Asian hate crimes are disproportionately likely to occur in **public spaces** and involve **strangers**, unlike anti-Black or anti-Hispanic hate crimes, which more often occur in residences and involve acquaintances.
- **Offender Demographics**: Asian Americans are more likely than other groups to be targeted by **non-White offenders**, challenging conventional narratives around racialized violence.
- **Geographic Distribution**: A nationwide map shows where anti-Asian incidents are concentrated‚Äîboth in raw numbers and normalized by local Asian population‚Äîrevealing how context shapes exposure to hate crime risk.
